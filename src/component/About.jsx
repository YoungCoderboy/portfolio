          Hey there! I'm a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student
          at Indian Institute of Information Technology Pune, and I'm rocking it
          with skills in C, C++, Java, and Python, along with a knack for Data
          Structures and Algorithms. I thrive on coding challenges and am
          venturing into Android and Web development, managing the robotic club
          with an amazing team of tech enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mt-20 font-game">
          On a lighter note, life outside coding is all about fun for me. I'm a
          massive anime fan, finding magic in captivating stories and vibrant
          animation. When not immersed in the anime universe, I dive into gaming
          adventures, from epic quests to multiplayer battles. And, of course,
          there's my love affair with Linux â€“ the open-source power is
          mind-blowing. Let's geek out or discuss the latest tech trends
          whenever you're up for it!
